# Benchmarks

The `pyarrow` package comes with a suite of benchmarks meant to
run with [ASV](https://asv.readthedocs.io).  You'll need to install
the `asv` package first (`pip install asv`).

## Running with your local tree

When developing, the simplest and fastest way to run the benchmark suite
against your local changes is to use the `asv dev` command.  This will
use your current Python interpreter and environment.

## Running with arbitrary revisions

ASV allows to store results and generate graphs of the benchmarks over
the project's evolution.  Doing this requires a bit more massaging
currently.

First you have to install ASV's development version:

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/airspeed-velocity/asv.git
```

Then you need to set up a few environment variables:

```shell
export SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION=0.0.1
export PYARROW_BUNDLE_ARROW_CPP=1
```

Now you should be ready to run `asv run` or whatever other command
suits your needs.
